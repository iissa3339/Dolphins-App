# Dolphins-App
Dolphins is an app that I have created for my Biology class when we were given a final project to pick a science topic not discussed in class\
and to make something creative that makes people want to learn more about it. I made the app using Android Studio using Kotlin with images from the web.
Feel free to download the source files and exploring Android Studio on your own, make a project in there and use some of my code if you like, I used radio buttons
and radio groups as well as regular buttons that would display pictures when clicked and basic layout things.
Intro Frag and Activity: explain what types of animals are dolphins and general facts about them and an introduction.
Resp Fragment and Activity: explain dolphins' respiratory system and how they can breathe under water.
Behavior Fragment and Activity: explain how dolphins breathing affects their sleep and other activities.
